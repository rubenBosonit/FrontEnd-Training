        <li class="story">
          Glenn Rhee was a survivor of the zombie apocalypse who was part of
          Rick Grimes' gang, and the boyfriend-turned-husband of Maggie Greene.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          Glenn met Rick during one of his frequent trips to Atlanta for
          supplies. After witnessing how the policeman was ambushed by several
          walkers, he helped him out of the predicament he was in by guiding him
          to a safe place through a portable radio.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          Before the dead rose from their graves, Glenn used to deliver pizzas
          for a living, and his knowledge of shortcuts, agility, and
          fearlessness came in handy for the group's gathering needs.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          While they were staying at the Greene farm, Maggie began accompanying
          Glenn on his tours and they began a romantic relationship.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          As the group settled in an abandoned prison, Glenn continued to be a
          valuable asset in protecting their new home from threats and an
          increasingly devoted companion to Maggie.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          After a period of relative calm and happiness with his new wife, Glenn
          fell victim to a deadly virus that spread through the prison and
          although he managed to save himself thanks to Hershel's care, the
          virus left him weakened just as the Governor attacked a again.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          Glenn was reunited with his wife, who thanked him for putting off
          saving the world to go find her.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          A new group of survivors had thus been formed, and together they
          headed for Terminus, an apparent safe community. When the place turned
          out to be a sham, Glenn and his friends were locked in an abandoned
          train car, and were later reunited with the rest of the group, who
          were also captured.
        </li>
        <li class="story">
          The situation worsened, and Glenn was about to be killed on Terminus
          to be used as food for the people who lived there, cannibals. However,
          the group managed to escape thanks.
